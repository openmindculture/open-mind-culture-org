Documentation
=============


Installation:

Just unzip the theme and put the folder sprachkonstrukt2 into your theme folder (wp-content/themes).
Then you should be able zu activate the Theme on your WordPress Admin Page.



Social Network Link Menubar:

The Theme includes a "Social Button Bar" on the left side. 
And this is how you set them up:

- Create a new Custom Menu
- Add Links to your social network profiles or your RSS feed
- Set the Title of your link accordingly
- Set the ”Social Buttons“ Menu to your created Menu
- Save it

Currently, the following Icons are available:

RSS-Feed-Icon 	– Title: RSS
Twitter 		– Title: Twitter
Facebook 		– Title: Facebook
Xing 			– Title: Xing
Flickr 			– Title: Flickr
Google+ 		– Title: Google

Note, that only the title attributes determine which Icon is shown.
If you add a link with a title different from the ones above, the link is not shown!

Custom Archive Widget:

A custom Archive Widget is included with Sprachkonstrukt2.
It is a very minimalistic Archive Widget, that I like better than the default WordPress Widget.
If you want, you can use it, it’s called ”Sprachkonstrukt Archive Widget“.
It looks best, if you have at least one entry per month and started your blog in a January.



Custom Headers:

If you don’t want the default Header seen on this page, there are a few other possibilities included.
Also, there is a Photoshop file (psd) included, that helps you creating your own layer. You may also add the Header Text in this image file, and deactivate the one WordPress creates.



Custom Main Menu:

You can build your own main menu (the green bar on the top) using the ”Menus“ Function in WordPress. Just create a (single-dimensioned) menu and assign it as the Menu for ”Primary Navigation“.
