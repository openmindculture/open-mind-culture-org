<h1>An Autumn Trip to New York</h1>

I'm not exactly a frequent flyer, but I took a trip to New York City, the capital of capitalism and consumerism, but also an exemplary melting pot of humanity or a utopian microcosm of the world, as the current <a href="https://dearnewyork.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Dear New York</a> exhibition puts it, featuring excerpts of the <a href="https://brandonstanton.com/humans-of-new-york" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Humans of New York story project by Brandon Stanton</a> and live performances in the Main Concourse of Grand Central Station. In this blog post, I will share some pictures and impressions of art, culture, and street life, as well as some practical takeaways from our preparations, expectations and our actual journey.

<h2>Things to do beyond the Clichés</h2>
There are many interesting and slightly less obvious things to do beyond the usual "must-see" tourist clichés. You could visit the <a href="https://www.amnh.org/">American National History Museum</a>, not far from Guggenheim. Its Richard Gilder Center for Science, Education, and Innovation features a unique architecture built like an ants nest and hosting actual ants. It was founded by the former US president and amateur scientist Theodore Roosevelt and inspired many other Natural History Museums around the world. Its extensive show rooms with large hand-painted backgrounds make it a kind of art museum in its own right. In addition to animals, plants and ecosystems, human habitats and artefacts are also on display. Updated information boards provide a contemporary perspective on old exhibits, such as the migration of the Lenape, the city's indigenous people.

<a href="https://www.open-mind-culture.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/NYC-2025-American-History-Museum-Richard-Gilder-Architecture.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5379" src="https://www.open-mind-culture.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/NYC-2025-American-History-Museum-Richard-Gilder-Architecture-225x300.jpg" alt="Architectural detail of Richard Gilder Center in New York City" width="225" height="300" /></a>You can walk the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Line">High Line</a>, a revegetated former train path in West Manhattan offering scenic views and contemporary art partially overgrown by urban gardens. You can visit the Brooklyn Museum and save on a combined ticket together with the adjacent Botanical Gardens. You can visit The United Nations Headquarters to see their eclectic art collection including the iconic Knotted Gun sculpture by Danish artist Swedish artist Carl Fredrik Reuterswärd, and enjoy a remarkable view of classic Manhattan skyscrapers.

You can cross a bridge over the river by bike near the deafening rattle of the Q train and the shocking bill when you end your ride, but bikes are definitely an option, and you get a bird's eye view of Manhattan's Two Bridges area more classically known as Chinatown, which I understand some see as the upcoming new hip village. Areas like East Village and Chinatown seem to blend in blurring lines anyway at least according to the New York Times survey about the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/10/29/upshot/new-york-neighborhood-guide.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neighborhoods of New York City</a>.
<h2>Being German in New York</h2>
<a href="https://www.open-mind-culture.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Was-ist-deutsch-Brooklyn-book-store-scaled.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5334" src="https://www.open-mind-culture.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Was-ist-deutsch-Brooklyn-book-store-298x300.jpg" alt="Was ist deutsch? Brooklyn book store" width="298" height="300" /></a>German things to do you can invite your American friends to beer, sausage and Belgian fries at Spritzenhaus in Williamsburg, pay cash, and rent a bike to get home. You can buy a kilogram of organic fruit when shopping groceries at a local street market, grab oats and oat milk at trader Joe's or have a seven-minute egg at Ciao Gloria where they still serve the coffee in ceramic pottery cups. You can refuse plastic bags and correctly separate your trash into organic, recycling and landfill. You can stop at every red traffic light, exit the lift on the ground floor, speak German in public and believe that no one understands you. What you can't do is open a window or expect food places to have a toilet just because they sell drinks. But if they have a loo, it's called a restroom and has sign that "employees must wash hands before returning to work".

America might seem more superficial than Germany, but also in a positive sense of being less pedantic about details that don't really matter or better stay untold. On the other hand, Germans, Austrians, maybe even most Europeans pride themselves for their historic and authentic material like glasses made out of real glass and reusable porcelain dishes, ceramic cups and metal cutlery served with care at your table. While Americans are said to be too honest and direct at times, that's even worse in many regions of Germany. Travelling abroad as a German, we should at least try to show our best side and still have an open mind for other people and their culture, as much or little that's possible in a short visit, and to view my hometown and country from a greater distance also changed my perspective beyond my trip, again at least a little.

New York is a gigantic city that you won't be able to grasp entirely, and as a traveller you inhabit the parallel world of tourists, pensioners and rich people that don't need to rush when walking their fluffy little dogs. New York looks like a sea of lights, seen from a departing plane taking off at night. In contrast, old European towns like Paris or Berlin, with their artfully composed structures of medieval parks and castles, look magical and sacred in comparison to a homecoming passenger that is still half asleep after a tiresome flight.
<h2>Preparing for Your Trip</h2>
My key takeaway so far for travel preparation: networking and personal connections are very important! Without up-to-date first-hand and authoritative information you might not even make it into the USA, and local tips can save you time, money, and prevent missing out on inspiring sights and events. Don't trust outdated or half-knowledge! Any advice or answer provided by a search engine or an AI chatbot might not be true or missing an important detail. Likewise, the following paragraphs are based on my own experience and research as a German traveller in 2025 and should be taken without any warranty, but rather with a grain of salt.
<h3>Clearance, VISA Application, ESTA Approval</h3>
Don't take for granted that you will be able to enter the United States, even if you have already paid for a hotel and flight tickets. Be prepared to answer unexpected questions when applying for a VISA or an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_System_for_Travel_Authorization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ESTA</a> approval or getting interrogated at your local airport even before you went through the security check. Beware misleading wording or translations. Blog posts with curated community comments, like the German <a href="https://www.jansens-pott.de/esta-antrag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ESTA Antrag – Anleitung und Ausfüllhilfe</a>, can provide helpful experience and interpretation in addition to the <a href="https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official ESTA application website</a>. You can't edit your ESTA application data after submission, and you can't take back a word that you said in the entry interview at the airport.

Don't wait too long to apply! A failed ESTA approval requires an alternative VISA application that can take too long to obtain it before your planned departure. Also, don't wait too long to watch and book flights and accommodation, or they might be booked out or got even more expensive. When you stay in Brooklyn, mind that it's a separate city in the American postal system, so "Brooklyn, NY" would be the correct city to enter in an address form, especially when there is no mandatory ZIP code field. Broadway, Vanderbilt, and Fifth Avenue exist both in Manhattan ("New York") and in Brooklyn, but they are not the same.

New York is expensive, and so is accommodation. Pet and house sitting communities like home exchange or Trusted House Sitters may partially replace restricted airbnb offers, but it takes time and patience to find a match and get an answer unless you are willing to care for elderly Labrador dogs in Staten Island 24/7 or trust a random stranger in the couchsurfing network. Other options that I haven't tried: house carers, nomador, kindred, and workaway, with the latter being no option as you are strictly forbidden to work with an ESTA or tourist VISA.
<h3><a href="https://www.open-mind-culture.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Cat-mascot-in-travel-case.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5376" src="https://www.open-mind-culture.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Cat-mascot-in-travel-case-225x300.jpg" alt="A plush cat toy in a travelling case" width="225" height="300" /></a>Mastering Modern Aviation as a Flight Passenger</h3>
I should be grateful that there are regular airways connecting most major cities of our world with each other. As first-world tourists, we are so much better off than the historic settlers or desperate emigrants on a sailing ship. Modern airplanes must be safer and faster than the steampunk zeppelin aircraft they had one hundred years ago. Intercontinental travel is still far from comfortable, and even the first-class priority passengers with the most expensive tickets didn't look much happier than the rest of my fellow travellers waiting for a delayed flight to board. Maybe the most tiring and annoying aspects of flying are not dehydration, altitude sickness or jet lag anymore, but spending hours, deprived of sleep and patience, standing in queues and getting bossed around at the airport before entering a delayed and overbooked plane with too little space and too little oxygen shaken by turbulent clouds until everyone feels sick.

Take your time to understand flight booking, if you're not already familiar with it. Round trip bookings are usually much cheaper than booking each direction separately. Consider pros and cons of direct flights vs. stopovers. You might risk missing the second plane if a stop is quite short. However, finding cheap flights is less of a challenge than surviving a long distance flight. Don't overestimate jet lag prevention strategies, but if you want to sleep, bring ear plugs or noise-cancelling headphones and a sleeping mask and try to fall asleep before flight attends start serving lunch at the most inappropriate time of day. Do anything to stay safe and prevent getting sick, dehydrated or sleep-deprived before getting into critical situations at border controls or standing between taxi agents money exchangers or worse looking for newcomers like you. Take your medication in a small handbag or backpack and try to get rid of dispensable cabin luggage if there is an option. Melatonin has become a popular over-the-counter drug in the USA, but I didn't feel any effect of chewing melatonin gums at all. However, my flight ticket included free wine in a brim-full paper cup that would have costed at least 60 dollars in Manhattan, and lukewarm coffee to tell my body when it's morning.
<h3>Phone Calls, Translation, and Conversation</h3>
Can you discern the numbers in American handwriting? Can you understand American English? My favourite misheard announcement is the "alligator in the middle of the platform" of a subway station. The same words might have different meanings on either side of the Atlantic. They might not fall for fall, and if they want to put your luggage "in the bin" that doesn't mean they'll throw it in a garbage can. Americans still use feet, square feet, yards, miles, pounds, pints, and gallons. Date wise, 10/10 means the 10th of October, so don't get those numbers in the wrong order. Maybe you'll start reading some blogs or magazines from New York, and listen to podcasts or music to get a feeling for it. "Madam", "ma'am", or "sir" might sound formal, but it's still a common and respectful way to address a stranger, and it's much better than the flippant "bye, bye, baby! Next!" that I heard at JFK airport. If in doubt, always prefer a more formal tone and say "good afternoon, madam!" especially when the person opposite you wears a uniform. "What's up?", the American equivalent of the German "Alles klar?", is more a greeting than a question. You can say "thanks, I'm fine, and how are you?" or you can just echo "What's up?" and proceed with your request.

Don't take for granted that your phone will work in the USA and if it does, phone calls and internet roaming might be extremely expensive! Check with your provider and consider getting an additional American SIM card if they don't have a flat rate option often called something like "Easy Travel USA" that, in my case, only cost 7,99 Euro in addition to my regular phone bill. A power adapter and/or a phone charger with an American power plug is important, and you probably know someone to borrow it for free. Last but not least, most travel blogs fail to mention the tasks of eating up food before leaving your home or passing it to a neighbor or interim tenant who cares for your plants while you're away.
<h2>Getting around without a Car</h2>
<a href="https://www.open-mind-culture.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/NYC-2025-Oldtimer-Dodge-Car-scaled.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5372" src="https://www.open-mind-culture.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/NYC-2025-Oldtimer-Dodge-Car-225x300.jpg" alt="Vintage Dodge oldtimer car parked in New York " width="225" height="300" /></a>You can get a free subway plan on paper at any subway station that has a clerk, and there are free apps to help you find your way around and back home.

You will definitely need at least one pair of good shoes!

New York is one of the walkable cities with a slightly European culture, which means that they do have sidewalks, bike lanes, and public transport, and that people actually use them. It doesn't mean it's going to be quick and easy though. You'll probably walk long distances and eventually take an express train in the wrong direction or confuse different streets and stations that have similar names. Remember your address and nearby bus stops and subway stations. Prefer subways, as they don't get stalled in traffic jams, but mind that their routes may vary at night or on weekends. For first-time visitors, public transport is just as confusing as it is in Berlin, but there is not even reliable internet underground, so make sure to start your navigation before going downstairs.

Uber and taxi apps show the price before you decide to ride, so you can compare and prevent getting ripped off when you're in a rush and don't know the way. Citibike provides classic and electric bikes that you can rent as you go and I found it to be not cheap but fun, especially in areas with plenty of bike lanes and not too much traffic. Specialized navigation and transit apps can be an alternative or complement Google Maps, and some are not limited to New York but will work in other cities as well, so you might try them out at home already.
<h2>Cash or Credit Card?</h2>
You will rarely ever need cash but if you do, don't think it is easy to withdraw with your foreign card even if it is a VISA. Make sure you know your PIN code and unlock North American payment and withdrawal in your banking app before you go. Local banks and ATM providers keep a fee and limit the amount that you can withdraw, so using your card might not only be easier but even cheaper considering the total costs. Check with your bank and recent travel blogs and forums to see if you're card is well-suited for transatlantic travel.
<h2>New York on a Budget</h2>
When on a budget check healthy fast food places like sweetgreen where you can stay use Wi-Fi and recharge your battery after ordering a cheap salad, use happy hours of bars and TooGoodToGo offers at bakeries and pizza places. There are public drinking water fountains some even specially suited for refillable bottles. Check last minute ticket selling services like TodayTix for reduced show tickets. Many museums are free to enter each first Saturday of a month. Entering the lobby and museums shop without a ticket you can already enjoy architectural highlights and exhibition previews in pricy places like the Guggenheim. However, others like The Brooklyn Museum only reveal their architectural beauty when you're inside. If you're a student, bring your ID and try to apply for a library card to obtain free or reduced admission in many places.

Some bills are cheaper when you pay cash, and if you're really running out of money, you can omit the suggested tip (baksheesh usually between 15 and 25% of the official price plus tax, or at least $1 in self-service fast food places) but don't omit tips if you can afford them. American employees often have little or no other income and really rely on them, unlike in Europe where tips are considered an optional gratitude "to buy a drink" (pour boire in French or Trinkgeld in German).
<h3>Time isn't (just) money</h3>
You will often pay more when you're in a rush. If you are flexible and have much time for preparation, start watching prices and accommodations right now! Unpopular flight routes and travelling times can save you a lot of money. Ride-share apps may offer a "wait and save" option, and many apps and services offer welcome vouchers, discounts or trial memberships for new customers if you register for an account at the right time.

Time isn't money, it's much more than that. It's easy to get distracted and stressed out on city trips. I caught myself searching for words or leaving things unfinished. That's more likely to happen when you want to do too much in too little time.
<h2>New York is no Hip Hop Video</h2>
I enjoyed the city, but I didn't feel its "empire state of mind", that combination of ambition, pride, hustle, and resilience. Maybe it just happens behind closed doors these days. It looks like everyone is just too busy to have fun during the day. People are smoking weed on the street, but it sometimes feels like the real New York is hiding somewhere. There are millions of people minding their own business, sitting in the subway with headphones, smartphones or an occasional book.

<a href="https://www.open-mind-culture.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/New-York-City-2025-Collage.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5337" src="https://www.open-mind-culture.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/New-York-City-2025-Collage-1024x968.jpg" alt="New York City 2025 collage" width="1024" height="968" /></a>

I accidentally visited the area where hip hop legend Jay-Z grew up, only to find a group of pensioners sitting in front of their project houses, a guy driving a Ford Mustang oldtimer car, and some occasional early signs of gentrification in the form of a hipster cafe that Google Maps suggested I should go to. Likewise, Crown Heights has become more gentrified and white in recent years, according to the New York Times article about its ephemeral neighborhood borders, and the area near Brooklyn Museum is now often considered a part of Prospect Heights, while some blocks below, I didn't see any other tourists or rich kids anymore.

The Village is another iconic example of gentrification, and it's still a beautiful and diverse place with arts and crafts and a unique mixture of European American and Asian people and culture. Museums and galleries like Guggenheim, The Met, MoMa and The Brooklyn Museum are surely worth a visit, but you shouldn't miss the Native American History Museum, listen to classic alternative hip hop lyrics and don't forget who paid the price for the Western world we often like to view as liberal and exemplary. How is it even possible that millions of people can live together in city without starving or running out of water?

While many people, places and situations are similar to Berlin, New York has a much greater variety of people, food, and events, maybe except for anything Arabic. There are Chinese, Korean, and Japanese people and places all over Manhattan, and if you don't like low-lit bars, you might love sharing a piece of layered cake or a scoop of Cotton Candy ice cream with a friend or fellow in an Asian Desert Bar and have a bubble tea or a pink creamy lychee cocktail with or without alcohol. I didn't notice any obvious indigenous Native American culture, but there are many Indians from India, and I had the best naan with lamb and masala chai since I visited Northern India decades ago. You might argue I'd better come back to India if that's what I'm looking for, and this takes me to some final thoughts concluding my little travel journal.
<h2>Should you go to New York?</h2>
New York is definitely worth a visit, especially when you are already in the USA or in Canada, but it's also overpriced and possibly overrated. Considering accommodation and flight costs, jet lag and border control you might prefer to spend your money somewhere else. It's funny how many New Yorkers praise Berlin and queue up at European food places like Döner Haus or La Lisbonata. I also heard people say New York reminds them of Vancouver, only bigger, and while that's not literally true, they might have a point. I'll have to check out Vancouver some day. If you choose New York, September and October are good times to travel as New York can get hot in summer and cold in winter. I visited New York together with my wife in October, we were lucky to stay in Brooklyn. We enjoyed some sunny and some cloudy days without too much rain, and we definitely spent too much money and made some mistakes, but I don't regret it.

I wrote this post to share some aspects you don't read in every other travel blog post and add a little gallery of some pictures that I took on my trip.
